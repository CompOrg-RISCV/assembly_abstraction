 	Assembly Abstraction assignment
 	Note:
 	  - As a minimum, you should plan to allocate registers for the following to
 	    to implement the routine

 	    - maximum count of loop which will be assigned your first initial lowercase
 	    - count variable, i, that will go from 0 to maximum count
 	    	- or, the count variable could be assigned max value and count to 0
 	    - result variable which is initialized to 0
 	    - memory address to store result initialized to 0x2000


 	    hint:  you can use the RISCV add immediate instruction, addi, to initialize
 	        a register
